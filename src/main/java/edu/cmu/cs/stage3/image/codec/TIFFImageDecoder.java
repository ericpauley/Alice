/**
 * A baseline TIFF reader. The reader has some functionality in addition to
 * the baseline specifications for Bilevel images, for which the group 3 and
 * group 4 decompression schemes have been implemented. Support for LZW
 * decompression has also been added. Support for Horizontal differencing
 * predictor decoding is also included, when used with LZW compression.
 * However, this support is limited to data with bitsPerSample value of 8.
 * When reading in RGB images, support for alpha and extraSamples being
 * present has been added. Support for reading in images with 16 bit samples
 * has been added. Support for the SampleFormat tag (signed samples as well
 * as floating-point samples) has also been added. In all other cases, support
 * is limited to Baseline specifications.
